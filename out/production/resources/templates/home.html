        <h4>About:</h4>
        <p>
            Computer Alchemist v1.0 is a RESTful web service offering easy and fast construction of your own  computer.
            API provides an interface thanks to which you can create your own repository of computer components and
            computer sets.
            The alchemist will ensure that the components selected by you are compatible with each other.
            You can build your own set literally in 5 minutes! If you have a problem with choosing a particular
            component,
            the application will prompt you and choose the most compatible part according to selected criteria, e.g.
            popularity.
        </p>

        <p>
            Component's data is stored in our database and you can get the information with one request.
            Additionally, there is the possibility of issue opinions, rates and comments about the component.
            Thanks to this you will quickly find out the advantages and disadvantages of the product.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Computer Alchemist's Pickpocket v 1.0</u> is an extension of Alchemist that provides even faster and simpler work with the API.
            Thanks to the Pickpocket module, you can only `POST` the URL link to the product in the online store.
            Pickpocket'll extract the product data for you, check its compatibility or compare prices at different online shops.
            At this moment, supported online store is <a href="https://x-kom.pl/">https://x-kom.pl/</a> , and soon also others.
        </p>

        <p>
            <u>Computer Alchemist's Store v 1.0</u> is a web service that allows users to create their own stores and services
            such as: computer assembly, repair, etc. You do not have to do laboriously, repeatable work like typing the product data,
            because our database already contains them! All you have to do is import the right product into your store
            and give it price, delivery time, form of delivery and payment.
            That's all! The application makes it extremely easy to create a store that could absorb many of your time and money.
